## Research Statement  
**[Triangulating AI Reliability: Evidence, Mechanisms, and Human Judgment](https://github.com/amshah1022/ai-reliability-agenda/blob/5c996fb8d73703d2632b70a5b8f6aa240339ef27/Triangulating_AI_Reliability___Statement_of_Direction__Alina_Shah_.pdf)**  
Outlines my direction toward a reliability layer for AI safety, integrating evidence-grounded evaluation, mechanistic interpretability, and human/rubric adjudication.

## Current Projects  
- **Truth Layer** – Evidence-grounded evaluation framework that defines truthfulness as alignment with verifiable evidence.  
- **MedSimAI (Future of Learning Lab)** – Rubric-anchored dialogic feedback chatbot (Cornell–Yale–UCSF) for consistent medical-education feedback.  
- **ProbeEng (LAISR)** – Ensemble of 1k+ probes mapping reliability signals across layers and token positions.

## About Me  
I’m an AI researcher focused on developing auditable, evidence-based evaluation systems that make model reliability measurable.  
My goal is to bridge mechanistic interpretability, evidence-grounded NLP, and human-aligned evaluation to build transparent AI pipelines ready for oversight and safety-critical domains.
