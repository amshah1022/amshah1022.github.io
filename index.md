## 🧠 About Me
I’m an AI researcher focused on developing auditable, evidence-based evaluation systems that make model reliability measurable.  
My goal is to bridge mechanistic interpretability, evidence-grounded NLP, and human-aligned evaluation to build transparent AI pipelines ready for oversight and safety-critical domains.
